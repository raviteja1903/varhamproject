          At the heart of our ecosystem is VAJRA OS, an AI-powered command and
          control platform. VAJRA fuses data from our network of robotic sensors
          and effectors into a single, intuitive operating picture, allowing
          human operators to command intelligent systems across any domain with
          unprecedented precision and scale. Itâ€™s the brain behind the brawn,
          enabling autonomous collaboration and dynamic mission execution.
