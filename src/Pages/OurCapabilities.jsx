            control platform. VAJRA fuses data from our network of robotic sensors
            and effectors into a single, intuitive operating picture, allowing
            human operators to command intelligent systems across any domain with
            unprecedented precision and scale. Itâ€™s the brain behind the brawn,
            enabling autonomous collaboration and dynamic mission execution.
